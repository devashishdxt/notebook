# Notebook

A simple notebook where I write my understanding of different concepts related to computer science. 
This is made using [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook).

## How to read?

**Notebook** should be accessible via [this](https://devashishdxt.github.io/notebook/) url. If,
you're unable to access above link, you can try following steps:

1. Install Rust programming language by following instructions on [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
2. Run `cargo install mdbook`
3. Go to `notebook` directory and run `mdbook serve`
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` (port is changeable) to read the book.
